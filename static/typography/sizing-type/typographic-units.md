For line length, use `ch` units! These units directly tie the optical size of the text to the max length before breaking to a new line. Multi-line text is usually recommended to break between 45-75 characters.[citation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/#the-ideal-measure-45-to-75-characters)

```css
.article {
  max-width: 75ch;
  width: 100%;
}
```
