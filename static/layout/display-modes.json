  "text": "In non flex or grid layouts, an external layout value of `block` will force an element onto its own line. In contrast, a value of `inline` will slot an element onto the same line as another inline element. Finally, a value of `none` will hide an element completely and remove its dimension sizing from the document–including elements inside of flex and grid containers.\n\nAn internal layout of `block` allows descendant elements to control their own, external layout value. However, an internal layout of `flex` or `grid` will force descendant elements into a flex or grid layout respectively–regardless of their own, external layout value.",
