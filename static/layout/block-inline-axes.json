The **block axis** is the vertical axis starting from the top, while the **inline axis** is the horizontal axis starting from the left.\n\nChanging the writing direction will augment these values, but they are relationally tied together. Both the start and end point of axes (along with the axes themselves) can be flipped, but they will always be opposite of each other.",
