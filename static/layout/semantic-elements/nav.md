For a group of navigation links, use the `<nav>` element. Ensure you use this element sparingly for core navigation relevant to a page. Ancillary links in elements such as `<footer>` don’t need to be wrapped in `<nav>` unless they include a set of related links for the page.

When adding multiple `<nav>` elements to a page, use the `aria-labelledby` attribute[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#labeling_section_content), in combination with a text level element and matching `id` attribute to distinguish between them.
