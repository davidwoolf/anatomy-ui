The `backdrop-filter` includes all of the same function options as `filter`, but applies it to anything behind the current element. This means the current element must also include some transparency in order to see the effect.[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) Currently, safari requires the `-webkit-` prefix for this property.

Background blur affects are a popular use of this property, blurring content passing underneath the element the `backdrop-filter` property has been applied to.
