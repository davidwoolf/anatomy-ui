A positive y value moves the shadow to the bottom, while a negative value moves it to the top. This means the values donâ€™t exactly map to a cartesian plane, but rather an imaginary global light source in the top left corner of the document.",

The spread radius value can be any positive or negative length and will expand or contract the shadow. Setting the blur radius to `0` and the spread radius to any value greater than `1` will create a sharp edged shadow offset.",
