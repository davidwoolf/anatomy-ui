Looking at elements inside of the card, do the descendants handle their positioning and spacing, or is this the responsibility of the card?\n\nThe card itself should generally handle layout details including borders and padding, along with the layout of its descendants, while the cardâ€™s container manages details including spacing between elements and max-dimensions. Avoid adding ancillary details like dimension constraints and outward spacing to base components to ensure consistent alignment and sizing on every device.",
