The `aspect-ratio` property can also include an `auto` value, which is useful when you want to start with a placeholder ratio for an item with unknown size–like an image. The explicit ratio size–let's say `16 / 9` in this case–will be used until the item is loaded and after that happens, the item’s calculated dimensions will be used.\n\n",
