The `<span>` element is an inline version of the generic `<div>` block element and while it is a useful text wrapping element, it should be used as a last resort if a more semantic text element isn't appropriate.\n\nThe `<span>` element is however, perfect for when you need to style a block of text within a paragraph but it has no other semantic meaning that would warrant using `<em>`, `<strong>`, etc.
