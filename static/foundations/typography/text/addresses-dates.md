Use the `<address>` element for any content related to physical or digital addresses. Address details can be grouped together and include informative labeling inside of the element directly.

The `<time>` element should only be used for dates, either as a datetime or duration. Use the `datetime` attribute for machine readable values, which can help browsers present actions like "save to calendar".
