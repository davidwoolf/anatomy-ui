When creating actions to submit data or perform non-navigation UI updates, use the `<button>` tag. While buttons are not required to be inside of form elements, it can be helpful to think of interface actions as data submissions when questioning whether a `<button>` is the proper tag to use. For example, a "Delete item" action is a data submission and would be a great use of `<button>`.
