To purposefully change the direction of a block of text, use the `<bdo>` tag in combination with the dir attribute.[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdo) To wrap a block of text whose direction is unknown at run time (e.g. pulling data that includes text in multiple writing modes), use the `<bdi>` tag, with no attributes required.[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdi)
