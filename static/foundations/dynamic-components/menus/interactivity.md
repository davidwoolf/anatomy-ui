The example above includes `tabindex="-1"` on menu button items, which is intentional. When creating menus, vertically oriented menus should use the up and down arrow keys for non-pointer based item selection (ie: mouse and touch). Horizontal menus should use the left and right arrow keys. Additionally, selection by typing 1 or more characters in their name is required for full implementation.

These interactivity features align a menu with native ui including non-browser menus and in-browser `<select>` elements.
