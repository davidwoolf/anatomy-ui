Popovers generally should not trap keyboard focus, as they are modeless and donâ€™t require action to continue using the rest of the interface (if they do, consider using a modal pattern). Additionally, popovers should generally be easily dismissible via a pointer click outside, hitting the `Escape` key, activating an outside element via the keyboard, and ideally an explicit close button within the popover itself.
