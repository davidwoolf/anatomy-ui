Both the dialog and `::backdrop` selector can be animated, but be aware that this only works when opening the dialog.\n\nFor more control over animations, descendant elements can be used alongside more Javascript. Or you can disregard the `<dialog>` element altogether in favor of `<div role=\"dialog\">`"
