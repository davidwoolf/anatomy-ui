Headings provide structure and natural segmentation to your content and are an important semantic device for understanding the structure of a page.

## Usage

HTML includes `<h1>` through `<h6>`, each creating a block element. When using headings, avoid multiple `<h1>` elements. It's also important to not skip heading levels in distinctive sections of content; skipping from `<h1>` to `<h3>` without including an `<h2>` is considered bad practice.[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#usage_notes)

Because headings are an important semantic device for understanding the structure of a page view, consider how you want to compose app content holistically and give yourself the tools to control this structure within reusable components.

## Composability

In most interfaces, components are abstracted and reused in different contexts and orders. Therefore, including hard coded headings such as `<h2>` and `<h3>` won't work as they may get out of order. There are a couple ways to handle problems like this:

- create composable components where base componetns are passed as children
- add prop arguments for headings and other text elements

In general, use composable architecturesâ€“especially if the main goal of the component is to abstract styling rather than stateful functionality. This mirrors static HTML element structure and encourages more atomic component systems. At a certain low level however, you may need to go the prop argument route.
