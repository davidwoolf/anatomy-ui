If a button controls the visibility of other content, it should include the `aria-expanded` attribute with a `true` or `false` value. In addition, if a button opens up content considered to be a popup, there are two additional attributes that need to be added: `aria-controls` and `aria-haspopup`. The `aria-controls` value should be the `id` of the popup's top level element.

The `aria-haspopup` attribute accepts one of the following values:

| value   | use case                                                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| dialog  | Popups that take over the screen. Examples include alerts, confirmations, etc. |
| menu    | Menu bars with dropdowns                                                       |
| listbox | Comboboxes design pattern with a list of items (one axis)                      |
| grid    | Comboboxes design pattern with a grid of items (multi axis)                    |
| tree    | Popup that shows a folder tree like structure                                  |
| true    | Exists for ARIA 1.0 backwards compatibility and is the same as usingÂ menu      |
