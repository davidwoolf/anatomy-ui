The accordion item itself should include an `id` matching the `aria-controls` attribute value of the trigger element. In addition, a `aria-labelledby` attribute should match the `id` attribute value of the trigger element, tying the trigger and item to each other. Finally, the `role="region"` attribute should be applied for accordions that support multiple items being open and with less than six items.
