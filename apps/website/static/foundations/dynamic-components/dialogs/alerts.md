For dialogs that show important messages and require a confirmation or cancel action, use the `alertdialog` role:

```html
<div role="alertdialog">
  <button>cancel</button>
  <button>confirm</button>
</div>
```

Alert dialogs are useful for situations such as confirming a destructive action or when an error requires user input to address it, and they are always considered modals since a blocking action is required.[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alertdialog_role#description)
