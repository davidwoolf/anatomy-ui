Lists of items can be grouped using the `<li>` tag for each items, along with a required parent element for either undorered `<ul>` lists or ordered `<ol>` lists.[citation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li) In addition, the `<menu>` tag can be used to wrap list items and is considered the same as a `<ul>`, except itâ€™s semantically meant for interactive groups of items.

The main difference between `<menu>` and `<nav>` is that `<menu>` is **not** for site navigation. As a rule of thumb, use `<menu>` when grouping a list of buttons and `<nav>` when grouping a list of links.
