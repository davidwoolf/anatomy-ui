In most interfaces, components are abstracted and reused in different contexts and orders. Therefore, including hard coded headings such as `<h2>` and `<h3>` won't work as they may get out of order. There are a couple ways to handle problems like this:

- create composable components where base componetns are passed as children
- add prop arguments for headings and other text elements

In general, use composable architecturesâ€“especially if the main goal of the component is to abstract styling rather than stateful functionality. This mirrors static HTML element structure and encourages more atomic component systems. At a certain low level however, you may need to go the prop argument route.
