Therefore, a 100px wide box with 24px of left padding and 24px of right padding will by 148px wide.\n\nBorder box sizing on the other hand, calculates padding and border widths within the defined width and height. Therefore, a 100px wide box with 24px of left padding and 24px of right padding will by 100px wide.",
